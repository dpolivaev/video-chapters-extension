- "Headlines should be detailed, reflect the content, and match the individuality of the video participants"
- "For each headline, provide the main thesis in one sentence in [LANGUAGE] without prefixes like 'Thesis:'"
- "For each headline, provide both thesis and counter-argument"

### Instruction History

* **Save frequently used instructions** for easy reuse
* **Click on saved instructions** to automatically fill the input field
* **Delete instructions** you no longer need

### Results Management

## Privacy & Security

* **Data Transmission**: The extension sends YouTube video transcripts to your selected AI provider for chapter generation:
  - **Google Gemini models**: Data sent directly to Google's Gemini API (ai.google.dev)
  - **OpenRouter models**: Data sent to OpenRouter API (openrouter.ai), which forwards to the selected model provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, DeepSeek, etc.)
  - **User Control**: You explicitly choose which AI service processes your data by selecting the model
* **Local Storage Only**: All your settings and results are stored solely in your browser's local storage
* **No Extension Server**: The extension does not operate its own servers or collect any user data
* **Transcript Retrieval**: Subtitles are retrieved from YouTube using the same method the browser uses when users open the transcript panel
* **Minimal Permissions**: The extension requests only the permissions necessary for YouTube integration and session storage
* **Session-Only Results**: Generated chapters are stored only for the current browser session and are not persisted
* **API Key Security**: API keys are stored locally in your browser and only transmitted to their respective AI services
