* **Multiple Free Models via OpenRouter**: Llama, GLM, and other models with $0 usage cost

#### Gemini Models (Direct Google API)
* **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Most capable model for complex analysis
* **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Faster model optimized for speed

#### OpenRouter Models (Single API Key for Multiple Providers)

### API Key Setup

#### Option 1: Use Free Models (via OpenRouter)
1. Create a free account at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Generate an API key from your OpenRouter dashboard
3. Click the extension icon and select any free model (e.g., "DeepSeek R1 0528 (Free)")
4. Enter your OpenRouter API key
5. Generate chapters with no usage costs!

#### Option 2: Gemini Direct API
1. Get a free Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. **Note**: Gemini's free tier is sufficient for most users - no paid plan required
3. **Availability**: Gemini API is available in most countries. Users in supported regions should register for the free tier, which provides generous usage limits for chapter generation
4. Open extension options page and enter your Gemini API key
5. Select any Gemini model in the popup

#### Option 3: OpenRouter (Paid Models)
1. Create a free account at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Generate an API key from your OpenRouter dashboard
3. Open extension options page and enter your OpenRouter API key  
4. Select any OpenRouter model in the popup

**Note**: API keys are stored securely in your browser's local storage and never leave your device except when sent to the respective AI service.

**Cost Information**: The extension itself is completely free. AI model usage costs (if any) are paid directly to AI providers - no money goes to the extension developer. Most users can operate entirely within free tiers.

**Disclaimer**: No warranty is provided for external APIs and services. Free AI models may have usage limitations, rate limits, or availability restrictions that are beyond our control.

## Usage

### Generating Chapters

1. **Open any YouTube video** with captions
2. **Click the extension icon**
3. **Select your preferred AI model**
4. **Enter your API key** (required for all models - free models have no usage costs)
5. **Add custom instructions** to guide chapter generation (optional)
6. **Click "Generate Chapters"**
7. **Copy formatted chapters** from the results page

### Example Custom Instructions

You can also try running without any custom instructions to see the default AI behavior. Use the extension button on the results page to easily modify instructions or change models for the same video.

- "Headlines should be brief yet meaningful, reflect the content, and match the individuality of the video participants. Additionally write a brief summary"
- "Headlines should be detailed, reflect the content, and match the individuality of the video participants"
- "Write both the headline and one-sentence thesis for each without adding prefixes like 'Thesis:'"
- "For each headline, provide both thesis and counter-argument"

### Instruction History

* **Save frequently used instructions** for easy reuse
* **Click on saved instructions** to automatically fill the input field
* **Delete instructions** you no longer need

### Results Management

* **View Results**: Opens results in a new tab (or focuses existing tab for the same generation)
* **Back to Video**: Smart navigation that returns to the original video tab
* **Copy Chapters**: Copy generated chapters with video URL included

## Privacy & Security

* **Data Transmission**: The extension sends YouTube video transcripts to your selected AI provider for chapter generation:
  - **Google Gemini models**: Data sent directly to Google's Gemini API (ai.google.dev)
  - **OpenRouter models**: Data sent to OpenRouter API (openrouter.ai), which forwards to the selected model provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, DeepSeek, etc.)
  - **User Control**: You explicitly choose which AI service processes your data by selecting the model
* **Secure Storage**: Settings are stored in your browser's sync storage (syncs across your devices when signed in) while instruction history and results remain in local storage only
* **No Extension Server**: The extension does not operate its own servers or collect any user data
* **Transcript Retrieval**: Subtitles are retrieved from YouTube using the same method the browser uses when users open the transcript panel
* **Minimal Permissions**: The extension requests only the permissions necessary for YouTube integration and session storage
* **Session-Only Results**: Generated chapters are stored only for the current browser session and are not persisted
* **API Key Security**: API keys are stored locally in your browser and only transmitted to their respective AI services
* **Localized Interface**: Extension interface automatically adapts to your browser language (supports 12 languages)
